# Timed-Multiple-Choice-Quiz

This quiz has a timer set at 2.5 min
when a wrong answer is chosen, 10 seconds are deducted from the time remaining

DOM manipulation is used to show/hide different elements on the page depending on what the user does/ how much time is left

The highscore feature has not been completed yet. I will resubmit once it is completed.
